Volume already climbing this could break out fast. Also big hedge funds extremely bullish on the security. Can be a big gainer if you can get a good entry before it blasts off. 2.05 and under best entry but with big momentum this could see much more then that",

          "body": "$CXDC adding here absolutely hands down no brainer rate alert for both near term gains and long hold investment. Do your dd don’t take my word for it. This company prints cash and turned down a buyout by Morgan Stanley for 5.21per share because it was too cheap. The price is artificially held down so they can try to frustrate the shareholders into selling at 5.21 Still representing 2.5x on any amount you invest however likely to up the offer to get a deal done. I will post the article detailing the information in my posts. This folks isn’t a question it is possibly the biggest opportunity you have to safely double your investment on as much as you want to invest. Again do your dd and don’t punch pennies trying to buy it. It is already offered to buy out at 5.21 minimum. Massive heads up alert 🚨",
